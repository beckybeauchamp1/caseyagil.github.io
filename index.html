						<p>The part everyone loves, talking about ones self...
              I have served in the Navy for the pasted 10 years where I have
              lived in Japan for roughly 7 of those years, San Diego for the
              other time.  I have had jobs as a Private Chef for a 3 star
              Admiral, a Nutritionist and Personal Trainer for the US Navy
              SEALS to where I am now working as an Assistant Warden.  I do
              not regret my time in the military but feel I am at a cross roads.
              Growing up I knew joining the Navy would only be my job, but
              now that I have learned a lot of different skills I am ready
              to start my career.</p>
						<p>I have been attending school at American Military University,
              because the military pays for the school for 5 classes per year.
              For the first few years I played around and did not utilize this
              resource.  But now I have been as much as I can, I am 12 classes
              away from obtaining my Bachelors of Science in Information
              Systems Security focusing on Digital Forensics.  Working in
              Internaional Military Corrections has shown me a lot of bad
              things people do on the Internet.  Working in the Digital
              Forensics field, I feel like I would still contribute globally
              while still playing with technology.</p>

						<h2>Thoughts</h2>

					<content>
						<p>When I attended our mandatory separation class
              where they teach us how to be marketable and how to
              do resumes I personally felt cheated not because they
              did not do a good job but because the material felt dated.
              I want to make the process better but need to
              learn the foundations first.</p>
